for stsj16:

day 1(0) start 32400
         end   61200

day 2(1) start 118800
         end   147600


databricks spark = 21
datastax cassandra = 20



to find answer to brian's question once we get vlsc16 data
select count(distinct user) from atech_clean_attendance where conf = "stsj16" and day = "0" and session = "20";


select user from atech_clean_attendance where session;

select session, session_name from atech_clean_session where conf = "stsj16" and t0 = "32400";
